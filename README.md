# SimplyPath

SimplyPath is a lightweight web app that helps you align your daily actions with
three layers of priority:

1. **Belief Framework** – renewal practices such as prayer, meditation, or
   affirmations.
2. **Core Skill** – the craft or competency you feel called to develop.
3. **Permissible** – interests and investments that are helpful but optional.

Within each category you can capture the main priority, a descriptive note, and
supporting subtasks. Everything is saved to `localStorage` so your plan is still
available when you come back to the page.

## Getting started

No build tools are required. Serve the directory with any static server (or open
`index.html` directly in your browser):

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```
